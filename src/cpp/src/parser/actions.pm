C99::Grammar::Actions - ast transformations for C99

This file contains the methods that are used by the parse grammar
to build the PAST representation of an C program.
Each method below corresponds to a rule in F<src/parser/grammar.pg>,
and is invoked at the point where C<{*}> appears in the rule,
with the current match object as the first argument.  If the
line containing C<{*}> also has a C<#= key> comment, then the
value of the comment is passed as the second argument to the method.
